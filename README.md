# GT's items.dat decoder
It decodes all items from items.dat and gets all items' descriptions and item mods from [GT Wiki](https://growtopia.fandom.com/wiki/).

Originally made for GTace, but everyone can use it now.

Thanks to GrowtopiaNoobs for [your decoder](https://github.com/GrowtopiaNoobs/Growtopia_ItemsDecoder).
