# GT's items.dat decoder
It decodes all items from items.dat and gets all items' descriptions and item mods from [GT Wiki](https://growtopia.fandom.com/wiki/). It outputs JSON file.

Also, when I (or you in fork/pull request) it automatically releases new items.json, so you don't need to run it on your machine everytime.

Originally made for GTace, but everyone can use it now.

Thanks to GrowtopiaNoobs for [your decoder](https://github.com/GrowtopiaNoobs/Growtopia_ItemsDecoder).
